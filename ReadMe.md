What is URI?
A URI is a string containing characters that identify a physical or logical resource. URI follows syntax rules to ensure uniformity. Moreover, it also maintains extensibility via a hierarchical naming scheme. The full form of URI is Uniform Resource Identifier.

Types of URI:

1. Get IPFS
2. Add tokenURI json file to IPFS
3. Add IPFS URI to your NFT URI

We go through creating 3 different kinds of NFTs.
3 contracts:
1. A Basic NFT
2. Random IPFS NFT (IPFS Hosted NFT)

- That uses Randomness to generate a unique NFT

3. Dynamic SVG NFT (Hosted 100% on-chain)

- Uses price feeds to be dynamic
